# all-the-callbag

This project will in the future generate the [all-the-callbag]() package.  In order to have your package included
in this package you can simply add the `callbag` tag to your npm package.

This package is created automatically by the travis scrapper.

Currently it is simply published with a 0.0.0 revision, however in future I will likely add some tracking to find
breaking changes etc and increment the semvar in a more reasonable way.

This project was built as an afternoon hacking project at my workplace ([Edument](https://edument.se)).
